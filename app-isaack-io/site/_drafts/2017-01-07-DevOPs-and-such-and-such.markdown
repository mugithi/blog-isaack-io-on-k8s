This post will mostly be a consolidation of my ideas and predictions on what is happening in our indsutry. Based on what I see and hear,  what I predict is going to be coming down in the next couple of years if the zombies do not finally attack.

I am very gratefull to work in one of the most technology diverse places in the world, Sillicon Valley. In my current role I get to interact in what industry calls verticals, mostly in the enterprise space. I focus in the enterprise space because that is where about 90% of all IT spend is.

### 2004 - 2009ish ###

A couple of years ago, I was working mostly in the storage space. I configured and sold storage for a living. In those days, one was highly paid to have either a Storage certification or a Networking certification. Cisco/EMC/Netapp were top vendors and companies paid top dollar to have a "certified engineer". This was because these storage systems were difficult to optimize and needed alot of hand holding to get them to perform to manufacturer's spec. Not only did I do primary storage, I was brave enough to venture into the backup world (shudder). I spent my nights doing migrations/cutovers of SQL clsutered servers that run Solaris and Microsfot SQL. Backup needed snapshot intergration for it to be cool and knowing how to configure Replication Mangager, Networker and Recoverpoint was very very cool. That was until a small company called VMware came along and I realized that this was going to be the next big thing.


### 2008 to 2012ish ###

In 2008, my manager decided to send me to a EMC/VMware bootcamp in Boston where I spent 1.5 months learning all about VNX and this new technology called virtualization (Can you imagine it took 6 weeks to train on this?)

Anyway, VMware was pretty awesome technology. I spent the next couple of years moving datacenters from being physical to virtual. Those were the days it was considered an important skill to know how to P2V servers and when they don't convert know what you need to do to massage Win2K to run inside VMware, driver cleanup etc. I spent most of 2009 in a project where every night I would convert about 50 physical machines in Arizona to virtual machines.  I was part of a 2-man team and we were done 3 months later having converted over 1200 virtual machines. This was the era that my VCP really mattered, moving from 4-5-6; Expanded it to NV and almost got Virtual Desktop.

I remember the first VMWorld I attended, sometime around the 2010 timeframe. It was packed and full of energy - everybody walked with a purpose. Sessions were difficult to get into, the labs would crash because everybody was trying to get the cool feature tested. By this time, I had been working with VMware for about a year and a half. The last VMworld I attended was in 2013, by this time I had sworn that I would not be attending any more of this and did not even attend the last two days.

At about this time, there had been a big push for prebuilt systems VBLOCK, FlexPod. Cisco's, EMC's and Netapp's response to this new Virtualization technology. I also jumped into the band wagon and got myself some cert(s) and worked on quite a large number of projects around these products. The cool projects invoved multiple sites with replication - combination of Storage/Networking and VMware HA technologies like MetroCluster and SRM. But this was not to last.

### 2012 to 2014 ###

I took a detour in 2013. I started questioning the jobs I was working on. By this time it was no longer interesting to work on simple virtualization, networking and storage projects. I was starting to question my career path. I spent 2013 looking and learning big data. I was determined to transion to become a Hadoop professional which I did. I worked on a few projects and even managed to get myself a Cloudera Hadoop Adminstrator Certification (CDHA 4.1). One thing that I have been fotunate to do is to be able to work on whatever picks my fancy - which tends to be what is current in the market with my employer.

Late 2012, a developer friend of mine came and told me about this cloud he had started using. He was paying $20 for a server that he was using for production, he was using Amazon - I was like huh? 2013 was the year that companies were trying to stay relevant in this brave world of cloud, these were the companies that I held most certifications with ie EMC/Cisco/Netapp/HP. They came up with certifications like cloud-{fill in the bank} certification. I am always looking to learn and so I dove right in. I soon realized that these folks had no idea what they were doing. I did get proficient in the only enterprise cloud solution at that time which was Eucalptus (before they were bought out by EMC), Cloud System Matrix(HP) and VCLoud Director which was later abandoned and to be replaced with VRelealize Automation from VMware. The customers I worked with primarily were not affected during these years - hey there was no concensous in the market and the main change catalyst - CIO magazine and developers really were not hearing a coherent message that could radically cause change in how IT was done.

### 2014 to 2016 ###

This was the year of the Cloud. I got to attend my first AWS conference in Las Vegas Nov of 2014. I remember because I took my newly wed wife (her first visit to Vegas and she loved it). We met with friends also attending the conference and I remember in Vegas an operations friend of mine who works at a startup explaining the power of containers and how it was going to change how we did things. AWS reinvent also had the same energy as the early years of VMworld. Here again, all attendees had a sense of purpose as they stutted the halls of Venecia and Palazo where the conference was held. But AWS is still public cloud and although throughout 2014-15 CIO magazine was tounting its benefits and were starting to see a shift with customers, public cloud is still public cloud. Developers were sold and so were CIOs, but there were also alot of changes related to adapting public cloud that enterprise operations folks still did not understand. The folks who had the closest relationships with this operations folks (AKA vendors) also knew that enterprise operations adapting public cloud would mean loss of business of selling hardware and so there was targeted marketing meant to smear the good name of public cloud, which in 2014 meant Amazon Web Services.

2014 was also the year of OpenStack with all its opensourcy goodness. Finally, here was a product that equipment manufacturers could rally behind. A product that had been purposely built to allow enterprise operations to keep running their applications within their datacenters. Everybody jumped on it including me. Traditionaly closed source vendors now started Openstack business units (EMC/Netapp/Cisco/HP/Dell etc etc) that marketed their products being fully compatibible with opensource -  and they could not hire enough employess from the opensource community to serve as their ambassadors.

I can say this period was also the year of Opensource. While the closed source vendors were busy marketing Openstack, they inadvertently ended up marketing Opensource as a way for Enterprise operations to solve business problems. This is something they previoiusly succesfully kept out of Enteprise operations. This change continued throughout 2014 to 2016, with each year Opensource which had not been traditionally accepted by enterprise kept gathering steam.

When talking about technology, it is difficult to talk about opensource without adapting its openness nature. I believe the OpenStack sell is what caused the traditionally closed enterprise operations to go and re-evalute how they did business and adapt the DevOps movement

In the next blog, I will talk about how DevOps adaption in Enterprise IT.
