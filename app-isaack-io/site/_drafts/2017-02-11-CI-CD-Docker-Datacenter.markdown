My wife is a heavy user of Godaddy. This weekend I saw the b$$l for the service they provide for her and I decided to migrate her to AWS, Docker Swarm Mode (yeah) and intergrate Jenkins into her CI pipeline. She is already using Compose to prototype her customers sites in her laptop so the move would not be difficult for her.
