![IMAG0007](https://fvtool.files.wordpress.com/2012/01/imag0007.jpg)

I just started a new job a few days ago. It looks like I am going to enjoy it. This year I promised myself that for the 365 days, I will do something hard I every day. I am especially happy because it requires that I get out of my shell. I tend to be an introvert, but with this job, I have to fight this every day. 

So, I have to pick up a tonne in terms of technology within the next 6-7 months. And that does not include the fact that I need to sharpen my people skills. I have to learn fast. The guys I have found in this company have quite a number of strengths that I am lacking. I am strong in EMC, VNX, Clarrion, Celerra and VMware. But I am weak in terms of hardware solutions. The goal of this month is to get up to speed with all the HP port folio. There are a couple of things that make money for this company, HP Servers and HP storage. I need to get up to speed with all of them. I am going to start with HP Blade class servers. I am not so worried about storage, EMC does storage better than HP other than the 3Par range of arrays, and this is because 3Par is under a completely different class. 

So this is my first post. There is also a lot coming, Recoverpoint certifications, VMware 5, UCS 5000,7000 blade servers, HP blade servers, programing, I was turned to powershell but I also want to take on python and Clojure before the end of this year. I also need to get my Netapp IE certification and Cisco Certifications for UCS. There is also Isilon IE that is pending. All this is going to take place before the end of this year. I am going to use this blog to document all of this and track my progress - try and keep me sane. Till the next post
