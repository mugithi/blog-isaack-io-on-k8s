title: Puppet - Creating a custom Module
wordpress_id: 283
---

So, I wanted to create a custom module for Puppet. Before I did that, I first setup three things. 



	
  1. Installed puppet and puppet client on to CentOS servers

    
  2. Installed Configured the web server to serve out the /etc/puppet/ through http 




I created custom NTP module that will turn ntp services on on the puppet client ntp and replace the ntp.conf with a file using a file sitting on puppet master web server.

Under /etc/puppet/modules/ntp/manifests/init.pp I created the following file


    
    <code># /etc/puppet/modules/ntp/manifests/init.pp
    
       class ntp {
          case $operatingsystem {
            centos, redhat: {
              $service_name = 'ntpd'
              $conf_file    = 'ntp.conf.el'
            }
            debian, ubuntu: {
              $service_name = 'ntp'
              $conf_file    = 'ntp.conf.debian'
            }
          }
    
          package { 'ntp':
            ensure => installed,
          }
          file { 'ntp.conf':
            path    => '/etc/ntp.conf',
            ensure  => file,
            require => Package['ntp'],
           <font color="#FF0000"> source  => "puppet:///modules/ntp/${conf_file}"</font>
          }
          service { 'ntp':
            name      => $service_name,
            ensure    => running,
            enable    => true,
            subscribe => File['ntp.conf'],
          }
        }
    
    include ntp</code>



To enable the module and allow puppet to apply it on my client, I added the following snippet to my site.pp file. My client was called puppy-client.dasherdemo.com


    
    <code>[root@hq-demo-puppet /]# cat /etc/puppet/manifests/site.pp
    node 'puppet-client.dasherdemo.com' {
    
          include ntp
        }
    </code>



In my web server, I created a file called puppetshare.conf in the folder /etc/httpd/conf.d. This shared the folder /etc/puppet out using http.


    
    <code>[root@hq-demo-puppet ~]# cat /etc/httpd/conf.d/puppetshare.conf
    PassengerHighPerformance On
    # Set this to about 1.5 times the number of CPU cores in your master:
    PassengerMaxPoolSize 6
    # Recycle master processes after they service 1000 requests
    PassengerMaxRequests 1000
    # Stop processes if they sit idle for 10 minutes
    PassengerPoolIdleTime 600
    
    Listen 80
    
        <font color="#FF0000">DocumentRoot /etc/puppet/</font>
        
            Options Indexes FollowSymLinks Includes ExecCGI
            AllowOverride All
            Order Deny,Allow
            Allow from All
        
    
    </code>



To source a URL as the source of a file in a puppet file, you use the "puppet:///" path. By default unless changed, if you use the code snippet "puppet:///modules/ntp/ntp.conf, it will look for the file at the following path, /etc/puppet/modules/ntp/files/ntp.conf broken as "puppet:///modules/module_name/file_name" translating to "/etc/puppet/modules/module_name/files/file_name"
